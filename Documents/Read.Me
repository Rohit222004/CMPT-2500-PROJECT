Days on Market Predictor for Vehicle Sales Optimization
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the number of days a vehicle will remain on the market before it is sold. The solution involves cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, performing feature engineering, and training a Ridge regression model to make predictions. The project is structured to follow best practices in machine learning development, including modular code, configuration management, and clear documentation.

Running the Project
The project is structured as a Python package with the following directory structure:

1. Data Preprocessing
   Run the preprocess.py script to clean and preprocess the raw data:

This will:

 1. Load the raw dataset from data/raw/CBB_Listings cleaned1.csv.

 2. Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing.

 3. Save the preprocessed data to data/processed/preprocessed_data.csv.

2. Model Training
   Train the Ridge regression model using the train.py script:

This will:

 1. Load the preprocessed data from data/processed/preprocessed_data.csv.

 2. Split the data into training and test sets.

 3. Train the model using RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

 4. Save the trained model to models/ridge_model.pkl.

3. Model Prediction
   Use the predict.py script to make predictions on new data:

This will:

 1. Load the trained model from models/ridge_model.pkl.

 2. Load the test features from X_test.csv.

 3. Generate predictions and save them to model_predictions_combined.csv.

4. Model Evaluation
   Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluate.py script:

 1. This will:

 2. Load the trained model from models/ridge_model.pkl.

 3. Load the test data from X_test.csv and y_test.csv.

 4. Calculate and print evaluation metrics (RMSE and R-squared).

Notebooks
The notebooks/ folder contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model prototyping. 

 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset and visualize key trends.

 2. Feature Engineering: Create new features and preprocess the data.

 3. Model Prototyping: Experiment with different models and hyperparameters.
